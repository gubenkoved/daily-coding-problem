# Question

This problem was recently asked by Amazon.

How would you explain the difference between an API and SDK to a non-technical person?

# Answer

An API (in a narrow sense) allows to use invoke over the wire (network) programs someone wrote that run on some remote computer.

SDK on the other had is a set of tools someone provided that you can use to build your own programs.

Analogy: SDK -- is a toolbox that you can use to solve your problem, API is a set of phone numbers you should call to solve (may be the same) problem.
